# Router Simulation
 In this simulation we are simulation how packets through a router who has a bounded and unbounded buffer. The packet times are generated using an exponential distribution.

## How to run the Sim

### <u>Running all of them at once</u>
To run all questions at once: run the command 
`make`

### <u>Q1</u>
will out put the mean and variance of the random variable generator.

To run question 1: run the command 
`make q1`

### <u>Q3</u>
simulating the un buffered queue with rho values of `[0.25,0.35,0.45,0.55,0.65,0.75,0.85,0.95]`

to run question 3: run the command 
`make q3`

### <u>Q4</u>
simulation the un buffered queue with a rho value of `1.2`

to run question 4: run the command 
`make q4`

### <u>Q6</u>
simulating a buffered Queue with k sizes of `[5, 10, 40]` and rho values of `[0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4]`

to run question 6: run the command 
`make q6`
